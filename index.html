<p style="color: white;"> Have you ever tried to play a football game with your friends and tried to make the best XI of all time or current with teams well you can do that with a spin the wheel but you cant add positions to a spin the wheel thats why my random name genrator was one of the best out there because I added a code which is called 2nd name varriable which makes it possible to have the positions. </p> 
<h1 style ="color: white;"> How to play the game </h1>
<p style="color: white;"> Its played with 4 to 8 people and each person has to have a paper, You play in a 433 formation and then you either decide to play current team or all time team. To start the game you scroll up and press game at the top and then it will bring you into another screen which will have a box in the middle with a big botton in the middle called "Random team genarator" then it will give you a team within 11 or 13 team with 11 positions and one of them come up next to the team name. </p>
